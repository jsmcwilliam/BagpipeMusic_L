My tunes saved in Lilypond format

These files are generated for use in collections and as such do not immediately produce the tunes they mirror when compiled. In order to do this for individual tunes there is a section at the top of each file which is commented out using %{.....%}. This sections has to be made accessible before compilation by removing the comment brackets. When this is done the individual tune pdf will become available.
